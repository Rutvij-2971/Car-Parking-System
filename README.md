ABSTRACT:

This is our concept of an simulator for car parking ,where we use concepts we have learned from M.P.C.A  to construct a mini model of the above stated where we construct a 6 slots parking working on the basis on sensors which detect movement (motion detector sensor-IR sensors) to detect whether a car is allocated to the respective parking compartment for the secondary car to relatively park in whatever compartment is available relatively in a sequential order, also two sensors are used to detect whether the car is entering or vacating the parking compartment based on which sensor detects motion first


in this project:
- the LCD shows available car parking slots
- the gate is operated by the servo
- there are proximity sensors at eachparking slot to detect presence/absence of vehicles
- proximity sensors are also present on either side of the gate to detect arrival and departure of cars


COMPONENTS USED:

Arduino Uno
20Ã—4 LCD Display
I2C LCD Module
Male Header
Female Header
IR Sensor x 8
Mini Servo Motor SG-90
